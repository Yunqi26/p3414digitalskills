      <h2>Story 1: The Battle of the Journalism on the Age of Digital Media</h2>
      <p>When the world enters the age of Web 2.0 from Web 1.0, the essential functioning of the human society has fundamentally changed into a high-speed, efficient, and inclusive community. Along with the rapid growth in economy, information technologies are able to spread to a large scale. Every walks of people’s lives are Internet-based. Employees communicate online, students study online, and the list goes on and on. This shift of the mechanism also has a huge impact on journalism. In the past, the journalism relied on the media, including print, broadcast, and TV. The development in information technology stimulated a transformation of journalism embedded in the Internet. The Internet gave the birth to digital journalism due to the fact that there are less people read newspaper and listen to the broadcast. Accordingly, journalism evolves its twin on digital world so as to still get touch to people who indeed need such information to keep up with the affairs of the world from a more authoritative source. However, while major journalisms find their voice on its own Internet website, the rise of social media shakes journalism’s place in gatekeeping and the way people receive news information. </P>

        <h3>1. Traditional Media to Digital Media</h3>
        <p>Traditional media used to dominant platforms which informed the general public with information, especially with regard to news. Print, broadcast, and television provided the majority of information people need. After the emergence of the Internet, those traditional news media platforms gradually lost their position in delivering news to the public. Specifically, during 1980s, around 40 percent of Americans got news from major news networks, including ABC, NBC, and CBS. However, in 2016, over 60 percent of Americans used social media to get news. The transition of journalism in different forms of media can be suggested from the transition of the American presidential election campaign.</P>
